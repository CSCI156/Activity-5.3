1. Redo your knock knock joke program so that a user can input the who and the punchline and get the joke printed out.

2. Write a menu program that chooses what to do based on user input. Print the following on the screen:
A. Input an employee’s name
B. Input a salary
C. Input a date of birth
using a function which returns the choice. Based on the user’s choice, call functions to do the appropriate work.
The users will input A,B, or C.

3. Bonus: research while loops in Python. Put your menu program into an infinite loop until the user selects exit, which 
should be choice D. Your program should also let the user know if they are not choosing one of the options, and then 
reprint the menu.
